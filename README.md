# JAVA
# What is java?

> Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. Java independent programming language is utilized for Android development,web development, artificial intelligence, cloud applications, and much more.
> Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere(WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.

* Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems_Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled java code can run on all platforms that supports Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

  ## Implementation of java application program involves a following step:
  > Creating the program
  > Compiling the program
  > Running the program

   ## CREATING THE PROGRAM
  > We can create a program using Text Editor(VSCODE) OR IDE(NetBeans)
  class Test
  {
     public static void main(String[]args)
     {
        System.out.println("My first Java Program.");
       }
  };

  ## Compiling the program

  > To compile the program, we must run the Java compiler(javac), with the name of the source file on "command prompt" like as follows.
